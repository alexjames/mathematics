# Numbers

### Fancy Counting
Everything is counting by 1.
 * 1 is +1
 * 2 is +1 +1 or "two 'plus one's"

### Place value
 * 4356 = 4000 + 300 + 50 + 6

### Variables
Anything that can "vary" or "change". For example, the number of newspapers you might sell on a particular day, or the number of
cars that my pass through a certain intersection. "x" and "y" are commonly used to denote generic variables. 10x is "ten times x".

Equations are usually written with variables.
```
5x + 4 = 5
7x + 3y = 4z
```

#### Solving equations
Since both sides of an equation are "equal", the LHS (left-hand side) = RHS (right-hand side). If two mathmatical quantities are 
equal, if you apply the same operation to both ends, their value will continue to be the same. To illustrate,
```
1 = 1
5 x (1) = 5 x (1) i.e. 5 = 5

"If y equals ten, 'ten times y' is 'ten times ten'"
y = 10
10y = 10 x 10.
```
